# Project README: MalwareInfectionSet Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
"MalwareInfectionSet" is a project dedicated to the scientific documentation and analysis of infostealer malware logs, discovered to be dumped online by malware networks. This project represents a pioneering effort in the systematic collection and study of these logs, offering unprecedented insights into the workings of malware networks. 

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: Infostealer malware logs available online.
- **Content**: Malware log dumps containing various data points related to malware infections.
- **Time Frame**: 2019 - 2020.
- **Origin**: 14 different malware networks.
- **Volume**: 1.8 million victim files, totaling approximately 15 GB.

## Modules and Functionalities
The project is structured into various modules, each designed for specific tasks related to malware data processing:

### 1. Malware Data Parsing and Database Management
- **Key Class**: `MalwareAnalyzer` - Manages the parsing of JSON files containing malware data and stores the processed data in a SQLite database.
- **Functionalities**: Creating and optimizing database tables, summarizing data, and managing large datasets using multiprocessing.

### 2. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Key Classes**: 
  - `SummaryDataVisualizer` - Visualizes summary data, including ratios between usernames, passwords, emails, and domains across various countries.
  - `ServiceAnalyzerVisualizer` - Analyzes and visualizes service-related data, focusing on domain analysis.
  - `DomainDataAnalyzer` - Processes and prepares domain-related data for analysis.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Parsing and Storage**: Efficient handling and storage of large volumes of malware data in a structured database.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the characteristics of malware infections, including service usage, domain names, and user credentials.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Graphical representations of complex data to reveal trends and patterns in malware activities.
- **Multifaceted Insights**: Insights into the geographical distribution of malware infections, most affected domains, and the prevalence of different malware services.

## Ethical Consideration
This project deals with sensitive and potentially harmful malware data. Strict ethical guidelines are adhered to, ensuring the data is used solely for research and educational purposes. The project does not engage in or promote malicious activities.

## Usage Guidelines
- Run the appropriate module for the desired analysis or visualization.
- Follow the prompts and instructions within each module to navigate through the functionalities.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed for successful execution of the scripts.

## Conclusion
